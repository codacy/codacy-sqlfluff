# Codacy SQLFluff

This is the docker engine we use at Codacy to have [SQLFluff](https://docs.sqlfluff.com/en/stable/index.html) support.
You can also create a docker to integrate the tool and language of your choice!
See the [codacy-engine-scala-seed](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-engine-scala-seed) repository for more information.

## How to run SQLFluff for the dialect of my codebase
By default, we run SQLFluff with the dialect Postgres because the flag --dialect is mandatory. If your codebase is based on another dialect above, please create a simple **.sqlfluff** config file in the root of your repository with the following content (let's use Oracle as an example):

```text
[sqlfluff]
dialect = oracle
```
It will run for all existing rules for the dialect Oracle

If you want to ignore some of the rules, please use the same configuration file:

```text
[sqlfluff]
dialect = postgres
exclude_rules = LT01,RF01
```

It will run for all existing rules, excluding LT01 and RF01, for the dialect Oracle


## Usage

You can create the docker by doing:

  ```bash
  docker build --no-cache -t codacy-sqlfluff:latest .
  ```

The docker is ran with the following command:

  ```bash
  docker run -it -v $srcDir:/src codacy-sqlfluff:latest
  ```

## Generate Docs

1. Update the version in `requirements.txt`

2. Run the DocGenerator to update all the patterns/descriptions and the patterns.xml (from all-patterns test)

    ```bash
    python<version> src/doc_generator.py
    ```

## Test

We use the [codacy-plugins-test](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-plugins-test) to test our external tools integration.
You can follow the instructions there to make sure your tool is working as expected.
